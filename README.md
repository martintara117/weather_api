## Description

The Weather Dashboard is a user-friendly weather app that allows users to search for a city using api's from Open Weather Map. It saves the users data in the nav bar so they may go back and see the weather forecast for cities they routinely visit. A user may also close the Weather Dashboard tab and reopen it again to see the last city searched. The Weather Dashboard provides the current weather forecast as well as a five day weather forecast.
